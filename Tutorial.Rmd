# Step-By-Step Tutorial: Deploit in action (aka in gifs!)

Now that we have an overview of how Deploit brings your resources in one place, and we have found what resources we will need, time to go back to the ```fastQsee``` tutorial to generate the FastQC report. 

<br>

All the resources that we will need can be summarized in the following table:

<br>

__What__ | __Where__               
:-----------------:|:-------------
DATA              | <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/1000fastq" target="_blank"><b>SRR062634.fastq.gz (1000genomes example file)</b></a>
CODE              | ```wget -O - https://lifebit.page.link/ftp_SRR062634_fastq_gz | gunzip -c > SRR062634.fastq``` 
OS/TOOLS          | <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/alpine-bash_Docker" target="_blank"><b>frolvlad/alpine-bash</b></a> & <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/alpine-bash_Docker" target="_blank"><b>lifebitai/fastqc</b></a> Docker containers
RESOURCES         | Lifebit Cloud <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/login_to_your_Deploit_account" target="_blank"><b>(provided with registration)</b></a>

<br>

Let's head over to the Deploit platform to generate the FastQC report step-by-step.

<br>


## STEP 0: Create a ```Project``` for your analysis tasks

For generating the ```FastQC``` report, we will deploy two jobs:

<br>

__1)__ One for retrieving the file<br>
__2)__ One for running the FastQC tool. 

<br>

It is advised to create a ```Project``` to host the individual analyses (aka jobs) of a workflow. Think of the ```Project``` entity in the Deploit platform, as your parent directory for the project. There, you will have access not only to the __data__ and __code__, but also to all the __```Jobs```__ that have been run. You will have the ability to revisit, clone and deploy again the same jobs very easily. 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/JobMonitor_Reults_CloneJob.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>


<a href="https://lifebit.page.link/login_to_your_Deploit_account" target="_blank"><b>Log in to your Deploit account</b></a> and access the ```Projects``` section from the light bulb icon `r emo::ji("light_bulb")`  on the left of your screen. Click on the green ```New``` button on the right, and provide a ```Name``` and ```Description``` for your new Project.

<br>
We set up the ```Project``` for this example by filling in: 
<br>

* ```Name       ```: __"fastQsee"__
* ```Description```: __"Quickly generate a FastQC report"__

<br>

You can find an overview of how these steps look on Deploit below: 
<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/create_project.gif?raw=true">

<br><br>

## STEP 1: Port the <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/alpine-bash_Docker" target="_blank"><b>frolvlad/alpine-bash</b></a> Docker container to Deploit

After you log in to Deploit, find the __```Pipelines```__ section from the navigation bar on the left of your screen. We will create a new pipeline in the ```Pipelines > My Pipelines & Tools``` section. 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/pipelines_my_pipelines_and_tools.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

This is how we will port the <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/alpine-bash_Docker" target="_blank"><b>frolvlad/alpine-bash</b></a> Docker container to Deploit, so that we can it use it for retrieving the ```fastq.gz``` file. Have the link to the Docker repository ready for copy+pasting <br>
URL to Docker Hub: <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/alpine-bash_Docker" target="_blank"><b>hub.docker.com/r/frolvlad/alpine-bash</b></a>
<br>

Have the link to the Docker repository ready for copy+pasting and then go ahead and click the green ```New``` button on the right.

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/dockerhub_url.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

As shown above, you will be prompted to select __"Where are you porting your pipeline from?"__. Click on the Docker whale and then click on ```Select``` to proceed. Continue by filling in the required fields to port the container. You can have a look at how we set this up below as an example: 

<br><br>

* ```Docker hub URL```: https://hub.docker.com/r/frolvlad/alpine-bash
* ```Name``` : __"wgetGunzipper"__
* ```Default command```: _(leave this blank)_
* ```Description```: __"A lightweight Linux distro for wget/gunzip__

<br><br>

The ```Default command``` is handy for saving time, but for now we will leave this blank so that we can use the command field as a terminal. You can see an overview of the process described above in the following gif:

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/create_new_pipeline.gif?raw=true">
<br><br><br>


## STEP 2: Use the newly created pipeline to retrieve and uncompress the ```fastq.gz``` file on Deploit

Time to use our newly created pipeline, and utilize the Docker container that we ported. We will use the command field on Deploit as a terminal, and the Docker container as our operating system to download and decompress the fastq.gz file we selected for this example. We will then deploy the job and come back to find our FASTQ file in the ```Data > Job Results``` section on the Deploit platform.

We will run the following command as mentioned earlier:<br>

```wget -O - https://lifebit.page.link/ftp_SRR062634_fastq_gz | gunzip -c > SRR062634.fastq```

Have it ready for copy+pasting, and let's go back to the Deploit platform.
Access the newly created pipeline that utilizes the Alpine Linux docker container (we named ours `wgetGunzipper`) by clicking:<br>

```Pipelines``` > ```My Pipelines & Tools``` > ```wgetGunzipper``` <br> 

Paste the command from above in the ```Executable``` field. Take a look at how this will look on the Deploit platform below:

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/wget_gunzipper_command.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

You can see an overview of the final command in the bottom of the screen: 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/final_command.PNG?raw=true">
<br><br>

Now we are ready to deploy the first of the __two jobs__ for retrieving the FastQC report.

Click on  ```Next``` on the top right of your screen. You will be redirected to the page where you will:
<br><br>

1) Select ```Project```, in which your job belongs to (we selected `fastQsee`)<br>
2) Select instance for deploying your job 

<br>

When you select both, you are ready to submit your job. Go ahead and click ```Run job```. You will be redirected to the ```Jobs``` page. Your job will be scheduled, initialized and be completed shortly. Take a look below to check how these steps should look in the Deploit platform.

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/select_project_select_instance_schedule_job.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

After job completion, you can access the decompressed FASTQ file in the ```Data > Job Results``` section. 
We expect to find our FASTQ file in the `fastQsee` ```Project``` folder, with a filename as we defined it when retrieving it  ```SRR062634.fastq```.<br>

__Reminder:__ This is the command we submitted to __download__, __decompress__ and __rename__ the ```fastq.gz``` file:<br>

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/final_command.PNG?raw=true">
<br><br><br>

## STEP 3: Use the uncompressed FASTQ file as input to ```lifebitai/fastqc``` 

Our input file for the next and last step, the uncompressed FASTQ file is now available on the Deploit platform in the ```Data > Job Results``` section. We will use this file as input for the ```lifebitai/fastqc``` pipeline, which is essentially a dockerized version of the FastQC tool and its dependencies. In the  ```Pipelines > PUBLIC PIPELINES & TOOLS ``` section, start typing `"fastqc"` in the search bar to easily find the ```lifebitai/fastqc``` pipeline.

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/query_pips_fastqc.gif?raw=true" >
<br><br><br>

Time to set up the pipeline. Let's:
<br>

1) define input data <br> 
2) select ```Project``` that the pipeline will be associated with <br>
3) select instance (cloud resources) 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/select_project_select_instance_schedule_job.gif?raw=true" >
<br><br>

As shown above we have selected as input data, the 1000geomes FASTQ file we fetched from the EMBL-EBI FTP server in the previous step. ```None``` other parameteres are required to run the `fastqc` pipeline. We then selected an instance (anything larger than 1 CPU would work).

<br><br><br>

### STEP 3 - Quick tip: Easily run available pipelines on Deploit
All curated pipelines included in Deploit's library, in the ```Pipelines > PUBLIC PIPELINES & TOOLS``` section, come with example parameters and data. 
Click <br> ```Try with example data & parameters``` to:
<br>
<br>

#### 1. Figure out the required flags and arguments to run the pipeline <br>
from the Deploit fields: 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/check_parameters.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

or from the final command field:

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/final_command_field_example_params.PNG?raw=true">
<br><br>

This way you can see how the command should look like when you customize the pipeline with your own parameters and input data. For example, as shown above we can see that the ```lifebitai/fastqc``` pipeline can be run just by typing:

<br><br>

```fastq name_of_my_fastq_file.qc``` 

<br><br>

Notice the `.fq` file format required and `None` other parameters.

<br><br>

#### 2. Take a look at output files of new pipelines 

<br><br> 

You can run with example parameters & data just to check the output files that the pipeline generates, and explore new pipelines and tools you haven't used before for your own omics data. You might discover another way you can interrogate your omics data and generate more results to inspect.


<br><br><br>

## STEP 4: Job completed! Time to inspect the FastQC html report

Once the job has been completed, you can access your results from the ```Job Page```, as shown below:

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/access_results.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

The ```Job Page``` serves like a summary report that includes information about:

<br><br>

* ``` Pipeline and configuration```: Name of Pipeline and configuration selected for this job 
* ``` Job status```: Job progress (% complete) or if it has failed 
* ``` Resource Monitor```: __CPU__ usage, __RAM__ requirements 
* ``` Table overview```: Runtime, number of processes, total cost

<br><br>

It also works as a portal to access all the generated output files in the ```Results``` section. 
Every job is assigned a unique ```Job ID```, so that you can reference back to them or to retrieve programmatically information about the job using your private key through Deploit's restful API.

<br><br><br>

## STEP 5: Share, reproduce, re-use


### Share
You can also share your ```Job page``` and hence analysis results by creating a public sharable link from the ```Job page``` as shown below:<br>

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/make_page_public.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

Anyone that has your public link can access your ```Job page```. Want to stop sharing? No worries! Just make the page private again and the url will lead to a cute tardigrade 404 page. <br>
Take a look below: 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/unmake_page_public.gif?raw=true" >
<br><br><br>

### Reproduce: 
<br><br>

#### Immutable Docker digests 

In the ```Job page``` you can easily access the Docker image digest. <br>

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/image_digest.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>

Digests are unique immutable Docker container identifiers and we choose to use those to ensure that the image we use when cloning a job is always the same. Tags are mutable and they don't guarantee reproducibility. You can read more about it in the official Docker Docs page <a href="https://lifebit.page.link/DockerDocs" target="_blank"><b>here</b></a>.

<br><br>
<a href="https://lifebit.page.link/DockerDocs"  target="_blank">
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/docker_digests.png?raw=true"> 
</a>
<br><br><br>

#### GitHub commits

<br><br>

If you port a pipeline from GitHub, you also have access to the GitHub commit so that you know exactly what revision you have used for running you're pipeline. Straight from the GitHub glossary  

You can access it from the ```Job Page > Pipeline and configuration> Revision``` as shown below:

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/GitHubCommit.gif?raw=true">
<br><br><br>


###  Re-use

If you have already run a ```Job``` on the Deploit platform, you can easily use the `clone` feature to revisit your pipeline. By clicking on __`clone`__ you will get a different ```Job ID``` but an automatic identical configuration set-up . You will be redirected in the job submission page.<br>

Take a look below: 

<br><br>
<img src="https://github.com/cgpu/fastQsee_helper_repo/blob/master/images/clone_job.gif?raw=true">
<br><br>


After cloning, you can easily modify the pipeline configuration as little (eg. change input file and keep all other parameters the same) or __as much__ (eg. modify everything by changing the parameter values) as you like. This helps you quickly modify and re-use pipelines. 

<br><br><br>
